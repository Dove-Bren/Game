 * Inputs take {}mappings to convert between different modes of input and stardard returns.
 * These maps will return certain object inputs when actual inputs are returned.</p>
 * <p>Event handling is to be done in a separate class. Hopefully this comment will be updated
 * by the time it is implemented</p>
